# linked-list-dna-simulation
The program processes DNA sequences stored in TXT files, which consist of randomly generated letter sequences. These DNA sequences undergo crossover, mutation, and a custom listing method to simulate genetic operations. The main objective of this project is to reinforce the understanding of linked list operations through practical implementation.

## Notes
This project was developed as the first assignment for the Data Structures course in the first semester of my 2nd year at Sakarya University.
